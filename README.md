# AI2hackalong
This branch contains the solution of the second #django hackalong of AI2 2016.

This week, the taks was a rather complex (but realistic) one. You should implement a 
small ShoppingCart service in JAVA based on CORBA. You should then use this CORBA object 
from within the django application, i.e. we are accessing a JAVA object from python! 

The key points of this week's implementation are located (and explained) in the 
files:

ShoppingCart/ShoppingCart.idl
ShoppingCart/ShoppingCartServer.java
KITshop/views.py

Much of the new code included this week was not written by hand, but was generated 
using an IDL compiler. 

In particular, the JAVA server skeleton was generated by executing the following command 
on the command line in the ShoppingCart directory: 

idlj -fall ShoppingCart.idl

Similarly, the python client stubs (located in KITshop/ShoppingCart_idl.py and the 
directories ShoppingCartApp and ShoppingCartApp_POA) were generated 
using the following command: 

omniidl -bpython ShoppingCart.idl

As a next step, we implement the methods in the JAVA server skeleton. We can then 
compile the JAVA server as follows:

javac ShoppingCartServer.java 

We are now done and we can test our application. For this, we first have to start an 
OBJECT REQUEST BROKER as follows: 

orbd 

We then start the ShoppingCartServer as follows: 

java ShoppingCartServer

Now, we can test this solution by running the django server from the command line:

> python manage.py runserver

This will start a webserver on your local machine and you can then add products to 
the shopping cart or view the contents of the shopping cart by accessing the following URLs:

http://localhost:8000/addToShoppingCart/123
http://localhost:8000/showShoppingCart
