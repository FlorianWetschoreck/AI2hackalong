# AI2hackalong

Dear students, 

This is the bare django application skeleton which we will be using in the #hackalong of AI2 2016!

This master branch contains an empty django application, which was generated using the command: 

`django-admin startproject KITshop`

This branch serves as the basis for the actual (increasingly complex) 
implementation of our web shop example. You can always revert back to this 
empty application by switching to the master branch. You can also peek at the 
solution by switching to the branch corresponding to the solution (see list 
of branches in gitHub). 

I hope you enjoy this voluntary hands-on exercise and I encourage you to 
contact me if you have any feedback or comments. 

Ingo Scholtes
